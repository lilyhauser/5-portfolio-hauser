School Involvement:
I am a freshman and AHS and a part of the Freshman Board. We organize fundraisers for the school and our class. Next year I plan to be on Sophomore Board and join Spirit Committee. I also want to play lacrosse next year. I was unable to join the team this year because of a knee surgery in October of 2018. I am in all honors classes. 


Who I am:
My name is Lily Hauser. I live in Andover MA and go to AHS. I am a freshman. I live with my mom, older sister, and two brothers. I have lived in Andover for 3 years and before I lived in Georgetown MA. I went to West Middle School in seventh grade and have been in Andover schools ever since. I have lived with my mom as my main parent for about 5 years now. I consider myself as very mature and responsible because of this. I am confident and know myself very well. 


Goals:
I plan to graduate AHS with good grades and go to a respectable college. At the moment I am interested in studying literature and art history in college. Also, while still in high school I want to get a job and also get my license before I graduate. I hope to save up enough money to buy my dream car, a baby blue Volkswagen Bug convertible. I want to have intern opportunities in college so I can have a job straight out of college. After college I want to get married and be able to design and build my own house. I want to have a dog and kids a fews years after I get married.
